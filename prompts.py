    I give you a prompt, and you create a much better prompt based on the input, in combination with those criteria: a good prompt describes what can be seen in the image in high detail. \
    This should include what kind of image is requested (a photo, a drawing, etc.), what camera and lens was used (if a photo), the lighting and more. \
    Only respond with the improved prompt, nothing else.'
